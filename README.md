## Basics

### IP and IP address:
An **IP**, short for **Internet Protocol** is a set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data.
 _Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called packets_.

An **IP address**, is an identifying number for network hardware connected to a network. Having an IP address allows a
device to communicate with other devices over an IP-based network like the internet._(Each internet device may have one
or more IP address)_

> There are 2 version of IP address: **IPv4** and **IPv6**
	- **IPv4** address:
		- 32 bits, usually written in 4 groups, each as a decimal, each decimal group represent 8 bits.
		_example_:
		```
		199.12.34.5
		```
	- **IPv6** address:
		- 128 bits, usually written in 8 groups, each is 4 digits of hexadecimal, separated by colon, with leading 0
		  omitted, each group of hexadecimal represents 16 bits.
		_example_:
		```
		2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1
		```
